# README

Poem.ai is my 2018 side project. This is a self-curated deep-dive into select topics in traditional machine learning, deep learning ,and some basic software engineering skills a data scientist should master.

## Why AM I Doing This?

I made a decision in the last year that I would devote in the area of data science for at least five years. I want to become more of a technical expert and use this to solve real social and business problems. I did this mainly for the following reasons:

- I am aware of that most important and practical knowledge and skills I get are from self-teaching. 
- The field of data science is changing dramatically on a bi-week basis. The only way to keep pace with the current technology is just doing it. 
- I want to cultivate an environment that will force myself to learn by doing no matter I can get an ideal job in the related field or not before July this year!
- I always want to combine computer science, math, arts ,and literature together. This project is related to the classic poem in English literature and it will also improve my personal skills in writing good poems, narratives ,and nice stories.
- I f*cking love it ,and am extremely motivated.

## How Will I Keep Myself Focused?

I will put a rigid structure on my self to keep sure I can make progress(Since my schedule is quite intense, at least in the first half of a year. Trying to get a master degree Cornell and landing a job in the States at the same time!) 

- I will spend at least two hours a day on this project.
- I will write a weekly and monthly summary on the github.
- I will use techniques such as scrum project management to facilitate this process.
- I will cut ruthlessly on some of my entertainment time this year including casual reading and movie watching. But I will keep cooking, playing martial arts, lifting weights and meditation to avoid myself being crazy and staying calm.

## What Will I Learn?

This key idea is learning by doing and I will dive into following areas:

- ***Software engineering skills to automate and systemize a machine learning model*** including: Good Programming Practice(Version Control, Debugging, Logging and Testing), Git and Version Control, Cloud Computing Platform(AWS), Web Scrapping,Requests, and Http Basics, Postgres Database, Herkou Development, Flask as a API endpoints and a web server, Basic Front-end(Html/Css/Javascript), Recommendation System Design.
- ***Machine Learning Fundamentals including:*** Deep Learning Built on Maximum Enthropy Model, Natural Language Processing(Especially on Word2Vec and related statistical skills in text classification and generation).

## What does success look like?

- Technical. Produce an accessible web application for users and have the technical expertise to lead the teams focused on the topics regarding natural language processing.
- Learning Science. Learning how to learn by self-experimentation and applying some related theory in the psychology and neuroscience field.
- Personal. Writing better poems at the end of this project.

## Roadmap, Auxiliary Mini Projects ,and Supplementary Courses

- Automating daily Google searching
- Automating daily Job Searching and Application by Selenium
- Learning NLTK with Python
- Matrix Factorization and Neural Networks
- Udacity Software Engineering Series
- Similar Projects on Github

## How Can You Help?

I welcome anyone even with fleeting shared interests in machine learning, engineering, litereature ,and poem to put me in touch! 

## Final Words.

Time to shut up and let the machine learning adventure begin.
